Built a regression model to forecast Significant Wave Height (SWH) using wind data, achieving strong correlation and
accurate predictions for maritime applications.
Analyzed the relationship between wind speed and SWH using regression coefficients to quantify the strength and direction
of their correlation.
Enabled data-driven insights for coastal and offshore planning by modeling SWH trends, supporting safer and more efficient
maritime operations.
prediction of swh using wind data also plotted graph and map of india when the Satellites passed and swh on the path of Satellites , i have taken 8 diffrent Satellites for trainig and 4 diffrent tsunami days  a 1 normal dat 
for plotting .
I have plotted 4 tsunami days to show how swh and wind is coorelated as wind and swh both readings are high on tsunami days and on normal days both are readings are normal.
